# Setting up StreamIQ at home

StreamIQ streams the media on your own machine (NAS, PC, Mac) to your browser
anywhere, without router configuration. Two programs run on that machine:

- **Jellyfin**, the media server that scans your files and plays them, and
- the **StreamIQ gateway**, one native binary that connects Jellyfin to your
  browsers.

Setup takes five steps. The gateway's local page (`http://localhost:8097`)
shows a status section for each of them.

## 1. Get Jellyfin

Pick one:

- **You already run Jellyfin:** keep it. It must be reachable on the same
  machine at `http://localhost:8096`.
- **Native install:** install [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/downloads), but
  **skip its setup wizard**. The gateway completes it in step 3.
- **Docker:** download `jellyfin-compose.yml` from the
  [latest release](https://github.com/bifi627/streamiq/releases/latest) into a
  folder of your choice. It is just Jellyfin, pinned to the version the gateway
  was tested with, on port 8096. Edit the media folders in it: one read-only
  bind per folder, any number of drives, Windows paths like `'D:\Movies'` work.
  Each `source` folder must exist. Then run
  `docker compose -f jellyfin-compose.yml up -d` in that folder and leave the
  setup wizard alone. The file is yours; updates never overwrite it.

## 2. Install the gateway

1. In the StreamIQ web app: **Gateways → Add gateway**. Copy the command for your
   shell. It contains a one-time token that is valid for 15 minutes.
2. Run it on the media machine:
   - Linux / macOS: `curl -fsSL …/install.sh | STREAMIQ_API_URL=… STREAMIQ_ENROLL_TOKEN=… sh`
   - Windows (PowerShell): `$env:STREAMIQ_API_URL='…'; $env:STREAMIQ_ENROLL_TOKEN='…'; irm …/install.ps1 | iex`
3. Open the local page it prints (`http://localhost:8097`). On Windows, allow
   the firewall prompt for private networks. The web app now lists the gateway.

The installer verifies the binary against the release's `SHA256SUMS` and
refuses a mismatch.

## 3. Connect Jellyfin

The local page's status shows **Jellyfin: reachable** and whether the gateway
has an **API key**:

- **Fresh Jellyfin** (wizard not done): nothing to do. Within seconds the
  gateway completes the wizard, creates the Jellyfin admin `streamiq` with a
  random password and shows that password on the local page. Keep it: you use
  it to manage Jellyfin.
- **Jellyfin already set up:** the page shows **Connect Jellyfin**. Sign in once
  with a Jellyfin administrator. The gateway creates an API key named
  `streamiq-gateway` and keeps only the key (`state/jellyfin.json`), never the
  password, so changing the password later doesn't break anything. Playback
  uses that user's libraries and watch progress (`STREAMIQ_JELLYFIN_USER` in
  `gateway.env` picks another user).
- `STREAMIQ_JELLYFIN_API_KEY` in `gateway.env` overrides both.

The page warns when Jellyfin runs a version the gateway wasn't tested with.

## 4. Add your media libraries

Open Jellyfin at `http://localhost:8096`, sign in as the admin (step 3) and go
to **Dashboard → Libraries → Add Media Library**. With the Docker compose file,
pick the folder **inside the container**: a bind with `target: /media/movies`
appears as `/media/movies`, not as `D:\Movies`. Jellyfin scans the library; that
can take a while for big collections.

## 5. Pair a browser and watch

1. In the web app: **Gateways → Open** on your gateway, then **Pair this browser**.
2. The browser shows a code. The local page shows a pairing request with a code.
   **Approve** only if both codes match.
3. Browse your libraries and play. The player shows whether the connection is
   direct or relayed. Each browser (phone, laptop, …) is paired once; remove
   browsers on the local page.

## Where things live

| | Windows | Linux / macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Install dir | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\streamiq` | `~/.local/share/streamiq` |
| Settings | `gateway.env` (yours, kept on updates) | same |
| Identity, paired browsers, Jellyfin key | `state\` (never touched by updates) | `state/` |
| Log | `gateway.log` | `gateway.log` |

`STREAMIQ_DIR` overrides the install dir. Set `STREAMIQ_NAME` and `STREAMIQ_PAGE_PORT` on
the first install to change the gateway's name or page port.

## Update

The gateway checks GitHub once a day. When a newer release exists, it logs
`update available vA → vB. Run: …` and shows the same on its local page. Run
that command:

- Linux / macOS: `curl -fsSL https://github.com/bifi627/streamiq/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh`
- Windows: `irm https://github.com/bifi627/streamiq/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex`

It stops the running gateway, swaps the binary and starts it again. Your
settings and paired browsers stay. Nothing updates without you running it
(notify-only for now).

## Start on boot (manual for now)

- Windows: `schtasks /Create /SC ONLOGON /TN streamiq-gateway /TR "'%LOCALAPPDATA%\StreamIQ\gateway.exe'"`
- Linux / macOS: `crontab -e`, add `@reboot cd ~/.local/share/streamiq && ./gateway >> gateway.log 2>&1`

## Releasing (maintainers)

Push a tag `gateway-vX.Y.Z`. CI (`release-gateway.yml`) tests, builds all six
binaries, and publishes the GitHub Release with `SHA256SUMS`, both install
scripts and `jellyfin-compose.yml`. When bumping the Jellyfin pin, update
`docker-compose.yml`, `gateway/install/jellyfin-compose.yml` and
`jellyfin.Tested` together (a gateway test enforces it). A tag with a suffix (`gateway-v1.5.0-rc.1`) becomes a prerelease,
which `latest` and the update check skip.
