# r8er signaling protocol

Contract-first (per CLAUDE.md): onboarding, broker, pairing, tunnel. Codegen
(C#/Go/TS from one schema) is deferred until the protocol stabilizes; for now
messages are hand-mirrored in Go (`gateway/internal/{onboarding,sessions,pairing,tunnel}`),
C# (`Features/Broker`) and TS (`frontend/src/features/pairing`, `frontend/src/tunnel.ts`).

## Gateway onboarding (MVP item 2)

Design: `superpowers/specs/2026-11-01-r8er-agent-pairing-design.md`.
Fingerprints everywhere use the form `sha-256 AA:BB:…` (32 upper-case hex
pairs, SHA-256 over the DER certificate).

**`POST /gateways/enrollment-tokens`** (Firebase Bearer) →
`{ token, expiresAt, installCommand, installCommandPowershell }`. Token is
random 128 bit, single-use, 15 min; the API stores only its SHA-256.

**`POST /gateways/enroll`** (no auth — the token is the auth)
```json
{ "token": "…", "fingerprint": "sha-256 AB:…", "name": "nas" }
```
→ `200 { "gatewayId": "<uuid>", "credential": "…" }` (credential: 256 bit,
shown once, the API keeps its SHA-256) · `400` malformed fingerprint ·
`401` token unknown, expired, or used.

**`GET /gateways/ws`** — gateway control WebSocket, `Authorization: Bearer
<credential>` (`401` before upgrade if unknown). Gateway → API, one JSON text
frame on connect and every 30 s:
```json
{ "type": "heartbeat", "lanUrl": "http://192.168.1.20:8097" }
```
The API sets `last_seen_at = now` and `lan_url` (http/https only, else null).
`GET /gateways` reports `online` = last heartbeat within 90 s. The same socket
carries the gateway's half of the broker (below).

## Broker (MVP item 3)

Tenant-scoped signaling. One JSON object per WebSocket text frame. The broker
relays SDP/ICE; it can't make either side trust the other (pins + pairing do).

**`GET /broker/ws`** — browser socket, **one socket = one session to one gateway**.
Closing it ends the session (broker sends the gateway `bye`).

| direction | message |
|---|---|
| browser → broker | `{type:"auth", token:"<Firebase ID token>"}` — first frame (not a query param: keeps it out of logs). Bad token → close `1008`. |
| broker → browser | `{type:"ready"}` |
| browser → broker | `{type:"offer", gatewayId, sdp}` — browser is the offerer |
| broker → browser | `{type:"error", error:"gateway offline or unknown"}` — also for another tenant's gateway (no existence oracle) |
| browser → broker | `{type:"ice", candidate}` |
| broker → browser | `{type:"answer", sdp}` · `{type:"ice", candidate}` |

**Gateway side** (on `/gateways/ws`): broker → gateway `{type:"offer", session, sdp}`,
`{type:"ice", session, candidate}`, `{type:"bye", session}`; gateway → broker
`{type:"answer"|"ice", session, …}`. The broker only routes a gateway's message
into a session opened *for that gateway*. The gateway keeps one PeerConnection
per session (several browsers at once).

## ICE servers + connection telemetry (MVP item 5)

**`GET /turn`** (Firebase Bearer) → `{iceServers}` for the browser's
`RTCPeerConnection`. Prod: Cloudflare `generate-ice-servers` (1 h TTL), passed
through. Dev: `R8ER_TURN_URLS` / `_USERNAME` / `_CREDENTIAL` (compose coturn),
else STUN only. If `/turn` fails the browser falls back to STUN. `?relay` in the
app URL sets `iceTransportPolicy: "relay"` (diagnostic; the e2e uses it). The
gateway stays on its own config (STUN, optional `R8ER_ICE_*`): the browser's
relay candidate is enough, as the e2e's forced-relay step shows.

**Telemetry**: once the tunnel is up the browser reads the selected candidate
pair from `getStats()` and calls `POST /connections`
`{gatewayId, relay, ipv6, localCandidateType, remoteCandidateType, protocol}` →
`{id}`; on close, `PATCH /connections/{id}` `{bytesReceived, bytesSent}` (stamps
`EndedAt`). Rows live in `connection_sessions` (tenant-owned, global filter;
another tenant's gateway or row → `404`). A closed tab skips the PATCH.
`relay` = either selected candidate is a relay. Chrome can report a relayed
local candidate as `prflx`; only relay candidates carry `relayProtocol`, so
that counts too. The same reading drives the player's privacy indicator
(polled every 2 s).

## Pairing + connection auth (MVP item 3)

Design: `superpowers/specs/2026-11-01-r8er-agent-pairing-design.md`. Browser
identity = non-extractable WebCrypto ECDSA P-256 **client key**; its
fingerprint = `sha-256 AA:…` over the SPKI bytes. The **gateway pin** = the
gateway's DTLS fingerprint (`a=fingerprint` of the answer SDP). The browser
checks the pin **before** `setRemoteDescription` and refuses on mismatch
(pairing again is allowed: the comparison code authenticates the new cert).

The browser opens a data channel labelled **`auth`** (JSON text frames). Until
it is authorized, the gateway closes every other channel immediately.

| # | direction | message |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | gateway → browser | `{type:"challenge", n}` — n = hex(32 random bytes) |
| 2 | browser → gateway | `{type:"auth", spki, sig, pair}` (base64; `pair:true` when the browser has no pin matching this gateway cert — forces steps 4–8 even for an allowlisted key, so a changed cert is only accepted via the code). `sig` = ECDSA P-256/SHA-256, **raw r‖s (64 bytes, IEEE P1363)** over `utf8("r8er-auth-v1\|" + gatewayDtlsFp + "\|" + browserDtlsFp + "\|" + n)` — both DTLS fps of *this* session, so a MITM can't relay it |
| 3 | gateway → browser | `{type:"ok"}` (key on the allowlist and no `pair` → tunnel channels allowed) or `{type:"unpaired"}` |
| 4 | browser → gateway | `{type:"commit", h, name}` — h = hex(SHA-256(utf8(nB))), nB = hex(32 random bytes) |
| 5 | gateway → browser | `{type:"nonce", n: nA}` — only after the commit |
| 6 | browser → gateway | `{type:"reveal", n: nB}` — gateway checks it against h |
| 7 | both | `code = uint32_be(SHA-256(utf8(gatewayFp + "\|" + keyFp + "\|" + nA + "\|" + nB))[0..4]) mod 1e6`, zero-padded to 6 digits; gateway page lists the request (name + code), browser shows the code |
| 8 | gateway → browser | `{type:"approved"}` after **Approve on the gateway's local page** (key persisted to `allowlist.json`; browser stores the pin), or `{type:"rejected", reason}` (Reject, 5-min expiry, >3 pending, bad signature/reveal) |

The commit makes the code ungrindable: a MITM gets one guess (10⁻⁶).

Once authorized, tunnel requests use the framing below, one channel each.

## Tunnel framing (MVP item 5)

The browser tunnels HTTP to the gateway's local Jellyfin over data channels.
**One data channel per request**: the channel *is* the request/response
lifecycle. There are no request IDs, no length prefixes and no multiplexing, so
there's no head-of-line blocking between requests. Any channel label other than
`auth` is a tunnel request.

Sequence on a request channel:

1. **Browser → gateway** (one text frame): the request.
   ```json
   { "method": "GET", "url": "/Items?parentId=…", "headers": { "Range": "bytes=0-99" }, "body": "{…}" }
   ```
   `url` is origin-relative. `body` is optional, a UTF-8 string of at most
   64 KB (small JSON for `POST`; `Content-Type` defaults to `application/json`).
   Headers are forwarded, except credentials (below). **`Range` must survive
   intact or seek breaks.**
2. **Gateway → browser** (one text frame): the response head.
   ```json
   { "status": 206, "headers": { "Content-Range": "bytes 0-99/9723", "...": "..." } }
   ```
   A refused request gets a head only: `403` (not allowlisted), `413` (body too
   large), `503` (gateway has no Jellyfin key), `502` (Jellyfin unreachable).
3. **Gateway → browser** (zero or more binary frames): the body, in ~16 KB
   chunks under `bufferedAmount` backpressure. A whole segment is never sent
   as one message.
4. **Gateway closes the channel.** Close is the body's **EOF** marker.

The head is a **text** frame and body chunks are **binary**, so the browser
tells them apart by type.

**Media bytes are untouched.** The gateway never negotiates or applies
content compression for the browser. Go's default transport would inject
`Accept-Encoding: gzip` and silently decompress, which rewrites the body and
drops `Content-Length`. Compression stays end-to-end. The one rewrite is
key redaction in text responses (below).

### Jellyfin policy (gateway, `gateway/internal/tunnel/jellyfin.go`)

The browser authenticates to r8er, never to Jellyfin, and a paired browser
stays a *viewer*:

- **Credential injection.** The gateway holds the Jellyfin API key
  (`R8ER_JELLYFIN_API_KEY`) and sets `Authorization: MediaBrowser Token="…"`.
  It drops browser-sent `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `X-Emby-*` and
  `X-MediaBrowser-*` headers, and `api_key`/`ApiKey` query parameters.
- **User pinning.** Every request gets `userId=<household user>`, and any
  browser-sent `userId` is dropped. The household user is
  `R8ER_JELLYFIN_USER` (a name), or the only Jellyfin user if there is one;
  it's resolved lazily and cached. Tenant = household = one Jellyfin user.
- **Allowlist.** An API key is admin, so only these pass (anything else is `403`):

  | method | path |
  |---|---|
  | GET | `/System/Info/Public` |
  | GET | `/UserViews`, `/Items`, `/UserItems/Resume`, `/Items/{id}` |
  | GET | `/Shows/{id}/Seasons`, `/Shows/{id}/Episodes` |
  | GET | `/Items/{id}/Images/{type}[/{index}]` |
  | GET | `/Videos/{id}/…` (HLS playlists, segments, subtitles) |
  | POST | `/Items/{id}/PlaybackInfo` |
  | POST | `/UserItems/{id}/UserData` (resume position, played) |

  The path must already be clean: no `..`, no `//`, no percent-encoding, not
  absolute. `{id}` is 32–36 hex digits or dashes.
- **Redaction.** Jellyfin writes `ApiKey=<key>` into the URLs inside its HLS
  playlists. Text responses (`json`, `mpegurl`, `text/*`, at most 16 MB) are
  buffered, the key is replaced with `redacted`, and `Content-Length` is
  recomputed. The follow-up request then carries `ApiKey=redacted`, which the
  gateway strips like any other browser-sent key.

Resume goes through `UserData` (`PlaybackPositionTicks`). Jellyfin ignores
`/Sessions/Playing*` reports from API-key callers, so those aren't allowlisted.

### Browser mechanism: hls.js custom loader, not a Service Worker (decided)

Playback is Jellyfin **HLS**, so a custom hls.js loader
(`frontend/src/features/library/loader.ts`) reads straight from the data
channel in **page context**, where the channel handle already lives. A Service
Worker would add a `postMessage` hop (the channel can't live in the SW). It
would also need register+activate before it controls the page, and it can be
killed mid-stream. A SW only earns its keep to put arbitrary Jellyfin traffic
behind a real URL (e.g. iOS native HLS, which needs a URL), so it's deferred
until a concrete need appears. The master playlist is loaded from a sentinel
origin (`https://jellyfin.tunnel`) that can never be fetched directly. The
loader strips it back to an origin-relative path, so nothing bypasses the
tunnel. Posters go through the tunnel too, as blob URLs.
